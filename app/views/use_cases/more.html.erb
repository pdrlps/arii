                        In financial environments, there is often the need to perform operations on multiple data formats, in order to check and report suspicious transactions. So, there is a need to identify corrupt transactions, for example, missing customer IDs from data that is stored in multiple files, such as CSV, TXT and XML.

                        Nowadays, companies need more up-to-the-minute information, so companies now look for ways to update their data warehouse faster and reduce transfer latency as much as possible.

                        ARiiP delivers changes to an ETL or EAI tool in batch or real time. This allows dramatic improvements in the efficiency of the entire process, reduces or totally eliminates batch windows, delivers information with low latency, and reduces the associated costs including CPU cycles, storage, network bandwidth and human resources.

                    <p>
                        An integrated data repository addresses a specific business area and provides complete and up-to-date information that can be used by business users and BI applications. This is stored in a relational database and receives updates from a dedicated set of programs, ETL or EAI tools. Given that the business need is ensured by an operational data store, it requires timely updates.

                    <h5><strong>Why ARiiP?</strong></h5>
                    <p>
                        ARiiP provides an efficient mechanism to keep an ODS updated by identifying and delivering the changes to the ETL or EAI tool on a continuous basis, rather than periodically querying the entire database for changes. In addition, ARiiP can push changes in near real time, in order to support ODS applications that have very low latency requirements.

                    <h5><strong>Scenario</strong></h5>
                    <p>
                       Dashboards provide managers with selected metrics (KPIs), that measure the performance of various business operations. Metrics that are not updated frequently, may mean that managers might become aware of a business problem too late.

                    <p>
                        ARiiP provides a method of identifying changes that occur to different data sources and that influence the measurement of a specific KPI. For example, an integration can come with data triggers that can process data changes, in a given order, and calculate new values of a specific KPI in a very short time period. This would provide better and timely information to the business user, resulting in much faster and more effective response to changing business conditions.
